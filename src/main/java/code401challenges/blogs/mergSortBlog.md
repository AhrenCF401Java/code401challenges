###Blog Notes: Merge Sort
Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that breaks an array in half and merges them back together in ascending order.
It uses  O(n log n) time

####Wiki on merge sort says

    "In the worst case, merge sort does about 39% fewer comparisons than quicksort method does in the average case. 
    In terms of moves, merge sort's worst case complexity is O(n log n)â€”the same complexity as quicksort's best case,
    and merge sort's best case takes about half as many iterations as the worst case."

##Algorithm
* MergeSort returns any array that's length is less than 2 because by default it is already sorted
* MergeSort then breaks larger arrays in half and then calls a MergeSort on each of the two halves breaking them again. this happens until all array's are < 2 in length. 
* then Merge a merge happens for each piece.
    * Merge takes in 2 arrays and creates an array equal to array1.length + array2.length.
    * Merge then orders them in accending order and sends them back to MergeSort
    
##Pseudocode
    ALGORITHM Mergesort(arr)
        DECLARE n <-- arr.length
               
        if n > 1
          DECLARE mid <-- n/2
          DECLARE left <-- arr[0...mid]
          DECLARE right <-- arr[mid...n]
          // sort the left side
          Mergesort(left)
          // sort the right side
          Mergesort(right)
          // merge the sorted left and right sides together
          Merge(left, right, arr)
    
    ALGORITHM Merge(left, right, arr)
        DECLARE i <-- 0
        DECLARE j <-- 0
        DECLARE k <-- 0
    
        while i < left.length && j < right.length
            if left[i] <= right[j]
                arr[k] <-- left[i]
                i <-- i + 1
            else
                arr[k] <-- right[j]
                j <-- j + 1
                
            k <-- k + 1
    
        if i = left.length
           set remaining entries in arr to remaining values in right
        else
           set remaining entries in arr to remaining values in left
