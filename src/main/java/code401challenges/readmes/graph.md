# Graph
A graph is a data structure tha maintains relationships between nodes. Social networking apps are a great implementation of this. I know jack and jack knows me and jack knows frank, but I dont.
In this graph nodes are tracked in a set and each node has an List that holds the nodes it knows.

## Approach & Efficiency
Getting to a node is O(1)
finding out what friends the node has is O(n) n being the size of the list.
