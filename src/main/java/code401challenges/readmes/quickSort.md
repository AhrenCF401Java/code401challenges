# Quick Sort

##
##Problem Domain
* Needing to sort an unsorted array in ascending order.
#
##Solution
* Select a pivot as well as a left and a right
* Check to see if the left is greater than the pivot if it is swap it with the right as long as the the one on the right is less than the pivot if it is not move the right pointer in and check again.
* Likewise if the left is smaller than the pivot advance it and if its bigger move it to the right following procedure above.
* call this recursively

## Approach & Efficiency
* recursive approach
* Its worst case is O(nÂ²), Its best case is O(n log n) and so is its average case.
