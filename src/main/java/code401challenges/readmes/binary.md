# Binary Search
* Takes an array and searches it for a number by spiting the array in half to minimize search time
### Challenge
Write a method that 
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the array’s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key.

## Explanation and other applications
1. Binary search takes the highest and lowest possible numbers of set/array indices/range of ints
2. it then looks for a parameter within the data. IE a specified #.
3. it divides the range in half over and over until it finds the thing specified.
